2. Click `Add project`.
3. Name the project (ex: `Chimera`).

5. Wait for the project to be created and click `Continue` once its done.
6. Click on the settings icon near `Project Overview`, in the top left corner, followed by `Project settings`.
7. Go down the page and click in the Source Code symbol inside the `Your apps` section.
8. Name this new app with the scope you want to (ex: `Web` or `Mobile`) and click `Register App`
9. Now grap the `firebaseConfig` object and use it on the project.
